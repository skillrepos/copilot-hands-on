# Hands-on GitHub Copilot
## Practical Tips and Best Practices
## Session labs (codespace version)
## Revision 2.0 - 10/04/25

**Versions of dialogs, buttons, etc. shown in screenshots may differ from current version of Copilot**

**Follow the startup instructions in the README.md file IF NOT ALREADY DONE!**

**NOTES:**
1. We will be working in the public GitHub.com, not a private instance.
2. Chrome may work better than Firefox for some tasks.
3. Substitute the appropriate key combinations for your operating system where needed.
4. The default environment will be a GitHub Codespace (with Copilot already installed). If you prefer to use your own IDE, you are responsible for installing Copilot in it. Some things in the lab may be different if you use your own environment.
5. To copy and paste in the codespace, you may need to use keyboard commands - CTRL-C and CTRL-V.**
6. VPNs may interfere with the ability to run the codespace. It is recommended to not use a VPN if you run into problems.
7. If you use the new free Copilot plan (no signup), some advanced functionality may not be available.

**Lab 1 - Learning how to create good prompts for Copilot**

**Purpose: In this lab, weâ€™ll start to learn about Copilot and how it generates code based on the prompts we provide**

1. Create a new file. In the terminal, enter

```
code index.js
```
<br><br>

2. Afterwards this file should be open in a tab in the editor.

![New file](./images/cdd262.png?raw=true "New file")
<br><br>


3. Let's see how Copilot responds to a generic request. Go to that tab and type in a comment that says

```
// function to parse data
```
![Copilot generated function](./images/cdd263.png?raw=true "Copilot generated function")
<br><br>

4. Hit return and notice the code that Copilot suggested. This is likely more generic than we want, but hit tab to select that line. (Note that you should give Copilot a second to provide code suggestions before moving on to the next line.)
<br><br>

5. After hitting tab, Copilot will generate another part of the function. (If not, you may need to hit return.) Hit tab to accept it. Continue until you get a complete function, function skeleton, or Copilot stops generating additional code suggestions. One example of what code may look like is below.

![Copilot generated function](./images/cpho5.png?raw=true "Copilot generated function")
<br><br>

6. This prompt is not specific enough for Copilot to interpret what we want to do.  Highlight the code and delete it, so we can try again.
<br><br>

7. Now type a comment at the top that says

```
// function to parse url
```
<br><br>

8. Hit enter and you will probably see a similar line to

```
function parseURL(url) {
```

or you might see an entire function definition.
<br><br>

9. Just hit Tab to accept it and Enter again. Copilot should continue to respond with another suggestion. *Only if you're not getting responses from Copilot, hit return and type the comment below to nudge Copilot.*

```
// parse url
```
![nudge comment](./images/cdd3.png?raw=true "nudge comment")   
<br><br>
10. Continue to iterate with Copilot suggesting lines and you hitting *Tab* to accept each line and then *Enter* until the function is complete. You may get some blank lines along the way or for some lines you might need to hit Tab twice to accept the code if it is indented more. But just hit return until you get to the end of a function or Copilot stops generating code. (You will be at the end when the indentation is done.  Also Copilot may start to suggest another function in comments like // test...)

<br><br> 
11. Let's do one more pass at getting a specific prompt for Copilot. Delete all the code currently in index.js. This time we will not enter a comment, but will enter a specific function name and parameter followed by an open left bracket and hit *Enter*. 

```
function splitURLandReturn(url) {
```
<br><br>

12.  With this function name, Copilot should suggest a reasonable next line - in fact it may suggest several.  To see the options, hover over the first line and a small window should appear. This window will show many options there are and provide "<" and ">" links to toggle between them.  If there is only one, you might try typing a space. Then click on the "<" and ">" buttons to see the differences in the available suggestions.

![alternative suggestions inline](./images/cdd269.png?raw=true "alternative suggestions inline")   

When you find an alternative you like, go ahead and tab to select it.

</br></br></br>

**Lab 2 - Using Copilot to simplify code**

1. Open an existing file we have in the project named prime.py. You can click on [**prime.py**](./prime.py) **in the codespace** or open it via the command below.

```
code prime.py
```
<br><br>

2. **Highlight the code** and switch to the Copilot Chat panel. (If you don't see the panel, select the Chat extension icon in the top bar to open the chat window.) Make sure the mode is set to "Ask". If you don't see the full Copilot panel or have access to the "Chat" area, check in the bottom bar of the codespace and see if there's a "Finish Setup" option. If so, click on that and then click the "Set up Copilot" blue button. If you need to change the mode in the Chat dialog, click on the down arrow next to "Ask/Edit/Agent" and select "Ask" (see second screenshot below).

   
![finish setup](./images/ext85.png?raw=true "finish setup")
<br><br>  

![change mode](./images/cdd264.png?raw=true "change mode")
<br><br>  
  
3. After highlighting all the code in the *prime.py* file, tell Copilot to simplify the code by typing *simplify* in the chat window and hitting *Enter* or the *Submit* arrow.

```
simplify
```

![simplifying via chat box](./images/cdd222.png?raw=true "simplifying via chat box") 
<br><br>

4. Copilot will likely provide an explanation of how it simplified things in the Chat panel. It will also create a new code block in the Chat panel with the simplified text. 

<br><br>

5. Hover over the simplified text in the Chat panel. A bar of controls will pop up. Use the second control to tell Copilot to insert the suggestion at the cursor to replace the text that's currently there. (Click on the control that's labeled as *Insert at cursor*. This should replace the highlighted text.)

![insert simplified text](./images/cdd223.png?raw=true "insert simplified text") 
<br><br>

   
6. Now, let's introduce an error into the code to see how Copilot can fix it. Pick an instance of a variable name and change it to one that doesn't exist. For example, change an instance of "n" to "x". 

![introduce error](./images/cdd226.png?raw=true "introduce error")   
<br><br>

7. Notice the light bulb icon that has popped up. Click on that, scroll to the bottom (if needed), and you'll have additional options to fix or explain with Copilot.  Select "Fix". (If you don't see the light bulb icon, you can right-click, select *Generate Code* and then select *Fix*.)

![Copilot options inline](./images/cdd270.png?raw=true "Copilot options inline")   
<br><br>

8. Go ahead and click on the "Fix using Copilot" or "Fix" option.
<br><br>

9. After a few moments, it should propose a fix that you can just accept (via the *Accept* button). (If it doesn't propose a fix in the dialog, you can skip to step 12 and use the /fix command in chat instead.)

![Fixing with Copilot](./images/cdd227.png?raw=true "Fixing with Copilot")       
<br><br>

10. (Optional) If you'd like, you can go back and make the error again, highlight the code, and then use the /fix command in the chat window to get similar results.

**Lab 3: Using Copilot For Onboarding, Explaining and Running Projects**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll look at how to use Copilot to help quickly get up to speed on any project**

1. For our labs in this workshop, we have a set of code that implements a simple to-do app, written in Python with a toolkit called *Flask*. We interact with it via curl commands for simplicity. The files for this app are in a subdirectory named app. You can look at the files that make up the simple app if you want.

```
cat app/<filename>
```

![cd](./images/ac4.png?raw=true "cd")
<br><br>

2. Since this is a new project to us, let's have Copilot produce some "onboarding" documentation for us. We'll use the #codebase chat variable to indicate it should do this against the contents of the current project. Enter the following prompt in the Copilot Chat dialog box and then submit it or hit *Enter*. (If you see a momentary flash about "Sign in to access Copilot", just wait till the dialog returns and enter the prompt again.)

```
Create an onboarding guide for #codebase. Do not create a separate block for it.
```
![Onboarding prompt](./images/ac11.png?raw=true "Onboarding prompt")
<br><br>

3. After Copilot completes its processing, you should the onboarding documentation displayed in the Chat output area. You can scroll through it to learn more about the project if you want. (You could also copy and paste the contents into a .md (markdown) file if you wanted to save it separately.)

![Viewing the onboarding guide](./images/cdd257.png?raw=true "Viewing the onboarding guide")
<br><br>

4. Next, let's ask Copilot to explain how to demo the code. Enter the following prompt in the Chat dialog.

```
Explain how I can run and see the functionality of #codebase.
```

![Asking how to run](./images/ac35.png?raw=true "Asking how to run")
<br><br>

5. In the Chat output, you'll see it reference one or two commands to start the server and one to run an example usage script. Hover over the command(s) to start the server. If you see a popup icon that looks like a terminal, click on that to insert it into the terminal. If you don't see a terminal icon when you hover over it, click on the "..." at the end of the popup and select "Insert into terminal". (If you see additional "[" "]" or other characters in the command, just ignore them and enter the "python app" command.)

![Enter command to start server](./images/ac36.png?raw=true "Enter command to start server")
<br><br>

6. In the terminal, hit Enter to actually start the server.

![Enter command to start server](./images/ac15.png?raw=true "Enter command to start server")
<br><br>

7. Because the running server is using this terminal, we need to open a second terminal to run the script. Do this by clicking on the "Split Terminal" icon that looks like a 2-column page in the upper right of the terminal area (see screenshot).

![Split terminal](./images/cdd271.png?raw=true "Split terminal") 
<br><br>

8. Back in the chat interface, find the output section with the command to run the usage script. Hover over that command and click the popup icon that looks like a terminal or use the "..." and "Insert into terminal" sequence to insert it into the terminal. (If you don't see that entry in the onboarding guide, you can try using the prompt "**Tell me about the example script to see functionality**" or just enter the command.)

![Enter command to run script](./images/ac37.png?raw=true "Enter command to run script")
<br><br>

9. Hit *Enter* and you can see the script executing running commands against the server. If you want to look more at what the script is doing, you can [view use-app.sh](scripts/use-app.sh)

![Script output](./images/ac18.png?raw=true "Script output")
<br><br>

**Lab 4 - Using Copilot to generate tests**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll see some examples of having Copilot generate tests**

1. Back in the codespace editor panes, switch to the *prime.py* file we were using in Lab 2. 

<br><br>

2. What if we didn't know how to test the code at all? Let's ask Copilot. Highlight the *is_prime()* function.

![selecting code](./images/cdd272.png?raw=true "selecting code") 
<br><br>

3. **Open a new chat** using the "+" sign in the uppper right and ask Copilot using the following prompt:

![Opening a new chat](./images/cdd258.png?raw=true "Opening a new chat") 

```
How do I test this code?
```
![prompting on how to test](./images/cdd217.png?raw=true "prompting on how to test") 

<br><br>

4. After entering this, you should see a plan for testing the code in the Chat interface. Copilot will also probably populate a block for you with the proposed test code. As we've done before, hover over the code block, select "..." and then "Insert into New File".
 
![insert code](./images/cdd274.png?raw=true "insert code") 

<br><br>

5. Save the file as *test_prime.py*. 

![save file](./images/cdd275.png?raw=true "save file") 

<br><br>

6. We can also ask Copilot for other cases to test. Select the code in the testing file you just saved and, in the chat interface, prompt Copilot with

```
What other conditions should be tested?
```
<br><br>

7. Copilot should respond with a list of other conditions to test and example code that you can add if you want and generate a block of code for them. Hover over that block of code and click the "Apply in Editor" icon (leftmost one). If prompted at the top of the codespace to select where to apply the code block, select the "Active editor 'test_prime.py'.

![Additional conditions to test](./images/cdd276.png?raw=true "additional conditions to test") 
<br><br>

![Select region](./images/cdd277.png?raw=true "select region") 
<br><br>

8. After this operation, you should see the additional test cases added to the file. You can review the changes if you want and just click the *Keep* button to persist them.

![Select region](./images/cdd278.png?raw=true "select region") 
<br><br>

9. Now, let's have Copilot review our implementation code in *prime.py*. In the *prime.py* file, select all the code (either highlight it all or use keyboard shortcut. Then right-click and select *Generate Code -> Review* from the menu.

![Having Copilot review](./images/cdd281.png?raw=true "Having Copilot review")
<br><br>   

10. After this runs, if Copilot has items worth noting, it will show the first one inline. You can scroll through the code to find the items that Copilot identified, along with any suggested changes.  If you want to apply the change you can select the "Apply and Go to Next" button. If you want to skip the change, you can click on the "Discard and Go to Next" button. If you look in the *COMMENTS* panel at the bottom (next to *TERMINAL*), you'll see all the comments listed and can navigate among them by clicking on the appropriate row. 

![Reviewing suggestions](./images/cdd282.png?raw=true "Reviewing suggestions")

</br></br></br>


**Lab 5 - YAML generation, API use, and translating code**

**Purpose: In this lab, weâ€™ll learn about how to have Copilot help with YAML generation, API usage, and translating code.**

1. Create a new file - **deployment.yaml**

```
code deployment.yaml
```

<br><br>

2. Bring up the Copilot Chat dialog via your keyboard shortcut and enter in the following request.

```
write spec for deployment in Kubernetes with 2 replicas and image from busybox
add command to run in containers: sleep 3600
add label app: myapp
add label type: front-end
```

<br><br>

3. After a few moments, you should see it respond with the code. You can just Accept this.
   
![Kubernetes manifest](./images/cdd259.png?raw=true "Kubernetes manifest")
<br><br>


4. Suppose we don't know how to execute this code. Let's ask Copilot. Highlight the generated YAML in the deployment.yaml file.  Then go to the larger Chat interface and ask it. Put the following in the Chat interface.

```
How do I execute this?
```

<br><br>

5. Copilot should respond with something like the following:

![How to execute deployment](./images/cdd188.png?raw=true "How to execute deployment")

<br><br>

6. While we're in the Chat interface, let's ask it for the latest K8s version. You can try both of the following.

```
What is the latest Kubernetes version?

What is the latest Kubernetes version that you were trained on?
```

<br><br>

7. Depending on the current model selected, you may get varying answers. In the case shown, the AI suggests that as of the current date, the current stable version is 1.31. The challenge with this is that the current version is actually 1.34.1 (as of 10/04/25).  Also, in this case, the latest version the model was trained on was 1.30. This highlights the out-of-date issue with the LLM.

![Answer to latest K8s version](./images/cdd283.png?raw=true "Answer to latest K8s version")

<br><br>

8. Let's have Copilot generate some code to work with Kubernetes through the API. In the chat interface, enter the following.

```
How do I call the K8s API for scaling a deployment to 5 replicas with Python?
```

<br><br>

9. The results may tell us that we first need to make sure something like PIP is installed. If so, we don't need to worry about this at the moment. Go to the actual generated code in the chat output. Click in that output area and paste the code into a new file via clicking on the "..." and then the *Insert into new file* menu option.

![Add code to new file](./images/cdd190.png?raw=true "Add code to new file")


<br><br>

10. Suppose we change our mind and want to convert this code to Go. Click in the new file, and highlight the new code. Then, in the Chat interface tell it to translate to Go. Then, look in the separate chat output and you should see the equivalent Go code available.

```
translate to Go 
```
![Go translation](./images/cdd260.png?raw=true "Go translation")

**Lab 6: Using Copilot's Agent Functionality to Implement a New Feature**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll see how to use Copilot to automatically implement a feature request to our codebase.**


1. We need to make sure our app is running. If not still running from lab 3, go ahead and run the command below in one of the terminals.

```
python app/app.py
```

<br><br>

2. Our code is missing a *search* feature currently. Try the following command in the second terminal.

```
# Search items:
curl -i \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer secret-token" \
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/items/search?q=milk
```

<br><br>

3. Notice that we get a 404 response and a message indicating that the URL was not found on the server.

![404 response](./images/ac19.png?raw=true "404 response")

<br><br>


4. In our repository, we already have a GitHub Issue for this feature. Take a look at it by clicking on this link: [GitHub Issue #1](https://github.com/skillrepos/copilot-adv/issues/1)

![Open issue](./images/ac20.png?raw=true "Open issue")

<br><br>

5. Let's let Copilot's Agent mode have a shot at implementing the feature. Open a new chat by clicking on the large "+" symbol in the top row of the Chat interface. Then, in Copilot's Chat entry area, change the mode to "Agent" by clicking on the drop-down labeled "Ask" at the bottom.

![Start new chat](./images/ac23.png?raw=true "Start new chat")

![Switch to Agent mode](./images/ac21.png?raw=true "Switch to Agent mode")

<br><br>

6. Once in Agent mode, open the *app.py* file to make sure we have it set as the default context. Either select it from the list on the side or use the command below to open it.

```
code app/app.py
```

<br><br>
  
7. Now, enter the following prompt in the chat area and then submit it.

```
Referencing the issue at https://github.com/skillrepos/copilot-adv/issues/1, propose a diff to our Python #codebase in /app that implements the requested feature. Do not create or add any tests.
```
![Context and prompt](./images/cdd266.png?raw=true "Context and prompt")

<br><br>

8. After Copilot processes the prompt, it may show one or two files changed - *app.py* and perhaps *datastore.py* - in a box above the Chat text entry area. Click on the "+ -"  icon on the right of the "2 files changed" area in the dialog. (See figure below).  

![View all edits](./images/ac24.png?raw=true "View all edits")

<br><br>

9. Take a look at the single or multiple diffs (#1 and #2 in screenshot). When you are satisfied with the proposed changes, click on the *Keep* button in the *Files changed* dialog (#3 in screenshot). Then you can close the tab that was opened to show the comparisons.(#4 in screenshot)

![Review edits](./images/ac25.png?raw=true "Review edits")

<br><br>


10. Now, let's try the *search* operation again. If your app was running when you made the changes in step 7, it should have automatically reloaded. If you see a message in its output of the sort "Detected change ... reloading", you should be good to go. But if you don't have that you can kill the process (CTRL+C) and then run the app again.

<br><br>

11. You can try the search operation with the same curl command as before. This time, it should run and return a 200 code rather than 404 since the search endpoint is implemented. If the item is found, it will return the found item. If not, it returns the empty set "[]".

```
# Search items:
curl -i \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer secret-token" \
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/items/search?q=milk
```

![Review edits](./images/ac26.png?raw=true "Review edits")

<br><br>

12. (Optional) If you have extra time, you can tell the agent to create tests for the change and follow through that process with the prompt below. Be prepared to select *Allow* as needed or tell it to continue/proceed in the chat dialog.

```
Create and run tests for the new feature.
```

![Running tests with agent](./images/cdd284.png?raw=true "Running tests with agent")

</br></br></br>

**Lab 7 - Extending Copilot with MCP Servers**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll see how to use GitHub Copilot with the GitHub MCP Server.**

1. For authentication to GitHub, we will need a GitHub personal access token (PAT). When logged into GitHub, click on the link below, provide a note and click the green "Generate token" button at the bottom.

Link:  Generate classic personal access token (repo & workflow scopes) https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,workflow

![Creating token](./images/mcp10.png?raw=true "Creating token")

![Creating token](./images/mcp87.png?raw=true "Creating token")

<br><br>
   
2. On the next screen, make sure to copy the generated token and save it for use later in the lab. You will not be able to see the actual token again!

![Copying token](./images/mcp11.png?raw=true "Copying token")
<br><br>

3. Now we need to add the GitHub MCP Server configuration in our IDE. You could fill most of this out via IDE prompts, but for simplicity, we already have a sample configuration file that we can just copy in. Run the commands below in the terminal. The last one will open the file in the editor.

```
cd /workspaces/copilot-testing
mkdir .vscode
cp extra/mcp_github_settings.json  .vscode/mcp.json
code .vscode/mcp.json
```

<br><br>

4. Next, we can start the local MCP server. In the *mcp.json* file, above the name of the server, click on the small *Start* link (see figure below). A dialog will pop up for you to paste in your PAT. Paste the token in there and hit *Enter*. (Note that the token will be masked out.)

![Starting the server](./images/mcp23.png?raw=true "Starting the server")

After this, you should see the text above the server name change to "âˆšRunning | Stop | Restart | ## tools | More...".

![Starting the server](./images/mcp24.png?raw=true "Starting the server")

<br><br>

5. To see the tools that are available, in the Copilot Chat dialog, make sure are in *Agent* mode, click on the small *tool* icon (see figure) and then scroll down to the *MCP Server: GitHub MCP Server* section. You'll see the available tools we picked up under that.

![Viewing available tools](./images/mcp25.png?raw=true "Viewing available tools")

<br><br>


6. Now that we have these tools available, we can use them in Copilot's Chat interface. (Again, you must be in *Agent* mode.) Here an example prompt to list out open issues in the GitHub repository the codespace is based on:

```
What are the latest changes in <repo name>?
Give me a list of the open issues for the current GitHub repo
```
</br></br>

7. Notice the mention of "Ran <tool name> - GitHub MCP Server (MCP Server) early in the output.

![Example usage](./images/ct162.png?raw=true "Example usage")

8. Now we can use the MCP tools to help answer questions in conjunction with our local changes. For example, assuming the first issue it listed was the one about "Add unit tests for existing Python modules", we can ask if our local changes resolve this. Try this prompt in the chat area.

```
Is the first issue in the GitHub repository already solved by my local code?
```

9. After you run this, Copilot will likely tell you that yes, the issue is resolved by your local changes. (If you need to *Allow/Approve* operations from the agent to complete this, go ahead.)

![Example usage](./images/ct163.png?raw=true "Example usage")

10. If you click on the *Extensions* icon on the left (#1 in the screenshot below), you'll see a category for *MCP SERVERS - INSTALLED*. This should show the GitHub MCP Server since we just connected to that.   

![Extensions and browser](./images/mcp97.png?raw=true "Extensions and browser")

11. If you then click on the globe icon (#2 in the screenshot above), you can get to another page that shows a list of available MCP servers to use.

**Lab 8 - Copilot in GitHub**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll see how to use the integrated chat interface in GitHub.**

1. To give us a project to work with, we'll fork a repository from my GitHub area. Switch back to GitHub in the browser and go to https://github.com/skillrepos/sec-demo. (Make sure you are logged in as your GitHub userid that has Copilot access.)

<br><br>

2. Fork the skillsrepo/demo repository into your own GitHub space via the *Fork* button at the top right. Make sure to **uncheck** the *Copy the main branch only* box on the second screen. Then you can click on the *Create fork* button at the bottom to actually create the fork.

![fork repo](./images/cdd172.png?raw=true "Fork repo")
![uncheck checkbox](./images/cdd147.png?raw=true "Uncheck checkbox")

<br><br>

3. After the fork is complete, in your fork, click on the down arrow next to the Copilot button at the top right and select *Assistive* from the menu. The chat dialog will open up and then you will have a chat input box and some suggested questions. Click on the *Tell me about this repository* question.  (If you don't see it, you can select one of the others or type in the question.) After this runs, you'll get some basic info about the repository.

 ![about the repo query](./images/cdd261.png?raw=true "About the repo query") 
 </br></br>
 ![about the repo response](./images/cdd248.png?raw=true "About the repo response") 

<br><br>
 
4. Now, in the list of files in the repo, select the *main.go* file to open it up. Start a new conversation in the Copilot Chat interface by clicking on the "+" sign. Click on the *Summarize this file for me* question or type it into the input area.  After this runs, you'll see a summarization of the file.

5. In this repo, we have a *dev* branch with some fixes for security vulnerabilities in the *main* branch. Let's create a pull request to merge the *dev* branch into the *main* branch. We could initiate the pull request manually, but since we have the Copilot Chat available, let's have it expedite the process by creating a simple link for us to use to start the pull request. In the Chat input area, tell Copilot to generate an appropriate URL via the prompt below and then submit it. After Copilot is done, you should see a link displayed.
```
Generate a url that I can use to create a pull request to merge the dev branch into the main branch
```

 ![generate pr link](./images/cdd251.png?raw=true "Generate pr link") 

<br><br>
 
6. Click on the link in the chat dialog. This should open up a screen with either a pull request already initiated or a file comparison screen with a button to create the pull request. If it's the latter, go ahead and click the button to create the pull reuqest for merging the dev branch into the main branch. (Close the Chat interface by clicking on the **x** symbol in the upper right corner of the dialog.)

 ![pull request initiation](./images/cdd252.png?raw=true "Pull request initiation")  

<br><br> 
  
7. In the pull request, update the title if you want. Then, we'll have Copilot automatically generate a description of our pull request. To do this, click on the *Copilot actions* button in the row under the *Add a description*. In the pop-up, select *Summary*. This will run for a few moments and then generate a draft summmary.

(**NOTE: *If you are on the free (not trial) plan, you won't see the Copilot icon in the pull request area. If that's the case, you can just create the pull request, open up the "Files changed" tab, pick a change and go to step 10*.**)

 ![generate summary](./images/cdd155.png?raw=true "Generate summary")  
 ![summary](./images/cdd156.png?raw=true "Summary")  

<br><br>
  
8. The summary will be in *markdown* format. You can click on the *Preview* button to see a readable presentation. When ready, click the *Create pull request* button to finish the creation.

 ![summary](./images/cdd157.png?raw=true "Summary") 

<br><br>

9. Notice that in the *Security Improvements* section, Copilot has generated links for each of the changes in the *models/models.go* file. Let's click on the 2nd link to look at those changes. (**If you do not have the links, you can click on the *Files changed* tab in the pull request to see the changes.**)

 ![looking at a change](./images/cdd158.png?raw=true "Looking at a change") 

<br><br> 

10. This will open up the change comparison screen. Let's ask Copilot for some more information about the highlighted change. On the right of the screen will be a small, floating Copilot icon with a drop-down arrow. Click on that and select the *Explain* option. After this runs, you'll see an explanation of the highlighted section.

 ![section explanation](./images/cdd160.png?raw=true "Section explanation")

<br><br>

11. Now, let's add a file to the context for the chat. Click on the *Ask Copilot* button at the top of the screen. In the *Select files to discuss* dialog, select *models/models.go*, check the box and then *Save* or *Start Chat*. You'll then see the file attached as context in the Chat dialog.
    
![add file for context](./images/cdd161.png?raw=true "Add file for context")
![file added to context](./images/cdd162.png?raw=true "File added to context")

<br><br>

12. Finally, we'll prompt Copilot about why the changes need to be made. In the Chat input area, enter the prompt *Why do these changes need to be made?* It will use this file as context and respond accordingly. Notice in the screenshot below, the indicator for *1 reference - models.go*.
```
Why do these changes need to be made?
```

We're not going to go through and resolve the pull request, so you are done!

# Appendix 1
## Alternate ways to "fork" repo if not allowed to use actual *Fork* button.

**Option 1 - Using Import**

1. Sign into GitHub if not already signed in.
   
2. Go to [**https://github.com/new/import**](https://github.com/new/import)
   
3. On that page, fill out the form as follows:
   
In "Your source repository details", in the "The URL for your source repository *" field, enter

```
https://github.com/skillrepos/sec-demo
```

Under "Your new repository details", make sure your userid shows up in the "Owner *" field and enter

```
sec-demo
```

in the "Repository name *" field.

The visibility field should be set to "Public".

![filling out form](./images/cdd195.png?raw=true "Filling out form")

4. If you haven't already, click on the green "Begin import" button.

5. After this, you should see the import processing... 

![import processing](./images/cdd196.png?raw=true "Import processing")

6. This will take several minutes to run. When done, you should see a "complete" message and your new
repo will be available. (There is a link in the complete message to click on to directly access it.)

**Option 2 - Using clone and push**

1. Sign into GitHub if not already signed in.

2. If you don't already have one, create a GitHub token or SSH key. If you are familiar with SSH keys, you can add your public key at
[**https://github.com/settings/keys**](https://github.com/settings/keys). Otherwise, you can just create a "classic" token by following the
instructions at [**https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-datasecure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-datasecure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic). If you use a GitHub token, make sure to save a copy of it to use in the push step.

3. Clone down the [**skillrepos/greetings-ci**](https://github.com/skillrepos/greetings-ci) repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/skillrepos/greetings-ci (if using token)
```

or 

```
git clone git@github.com:skillrepos/greetings-ci (if using ssh)
```
4. Create a new repository in your GitHub space named *sec-demo*. Go to [**https://github.com/new**](https://github.com/new). Fill in
the "repo name" field with "sec-demo" and then click on the "Create repository" button.
   
![create new repo](./images/cdd198.png?raw=true "Create new repo")


5. On the page that comes up after that, select the appropriate protocol (https or ssh) and then follow
the instructions for "...or push an existing repository from the command line" to push your content
back to the GitHub repository. If you're using https you will be prompted for a password at push
time. Just paste in the classic token. (Note that for security reasons, you will not see the token
displayed.)
